#HelloPy
Python is a very simple language, and has a simple syntax.
For example to print a string.
If your are familiar with C you be knowing u need to import stdio.h, then you need to declare an void main function, and the thing that need to be printed by printf(), but it won’t go to next line as it is.

But in Python it’s very easy to print a string.
You can write:

<code>
print "HelloPy"
</code>

Now the above code is for Python 2.

In Python 3 print is invoked as function

<code>
print("HelloPy")
</code>
