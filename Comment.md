#Comment
Comment is used to make code readable. A programming language has limitation that we cant be declared as we talk in general english. Moreover comments are defined so that a non programmer can understand the things a program is doing.

example:
```
def xyz():
  print "hello"

xyz()
```

Above code would not be understandable to a non programmer.

but Check out below
```

def xyz():#function with name xyz defined which would be used to print hello on screen
  print "hello"
  """
  The above print function is used to print anything that is provided to it using std:in
  """

xyz()
#xyz() is used to call the function which would call the defined function xyz() would print hello
```


The second block is more readable than first one. This type of comments are also used so that when in future if we refer our code we can check what and why we had written particular code block
