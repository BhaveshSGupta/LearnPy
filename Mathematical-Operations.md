#Basic Maths
Basic mathematical operations can be easily performed in python. Operation like addition subtraction multiplication and divide.
on IDLE you can write as follows it would give us answer.
```

>>>3+5
8
>>>5-3
2
>>>3*5
15
>>>10/5
2

```
Or if you want to declare variable then you can also do as follows:

```
addition = 3 + 5
subtraction = 5 - 2
multiplication = 10 * 5
division = 10 / 5

```
You can view output by printing them.

----
Above were basic mathematical operations. Now something more.
##Exponent
Exponent operation is used to calculate powers. That is 2 to the power 10 then answer would be 100 i.e. 10^2 =100. Exponent can be declared as 
```
>>>10**2
100
```

Note: double asterisk symbol is used. While in multiplication single asterisk is used

##Modulo
For those who python is first programming language, modulo operator is widely used in every programming language. Modulo operator calculates the remainder of the division of two number.
```
>>>3%2
1
```
