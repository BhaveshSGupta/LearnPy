#Indentation
Means the white space or space we or indentation is used to give structure to code.
```
def funt():
print 10

funt()
```

The above function call would not print 10
you would get IndentationError: expected an indented block error

Updating above code as below would remove "IndentationError:"

```
def funt():
    print 10

funt()
```

In Python Indentation can be provided by four spaces or single tab.
