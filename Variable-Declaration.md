#Variable
A variable in python is simply declared as follows:

```
my_variable=10
print my_variable
```

Output:
<code>
10
</code>

There is no datatype for variable.

You just simply declare them. I can even write as follows
```
my_variable=10
print my_variable
my_variable="hello"
print my_variable

```
Output:
```
10
hello
```
____________

Similarly
we can work with float and bool
```
variable_float=10.4
variable_bool=True
variable_bool=False	
```
